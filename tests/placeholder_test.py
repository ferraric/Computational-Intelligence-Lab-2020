"""
Our continuous integration pipeline ensures that pull requests can only be
merged to master if all builds pass. If there are no tests, by default the build fails.
This is a placeholder test in order to make the build pass. It can and should be
removed as soon as we have a first meaningful test.
TODO: remove this once we have another test
