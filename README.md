# Sentiment Classification - Computational Intelligence Lab 2020

## Description   
This is a project that was done in the Computational Intelligence Lab 2020 at ETH Zurich (see [Course website](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/teaching/2020/CIL/)).
Specifically we are doing a sentiment analysis of twitter data and classify them into positive and negative sentiments (see [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/cil-text-classification-2020)).
